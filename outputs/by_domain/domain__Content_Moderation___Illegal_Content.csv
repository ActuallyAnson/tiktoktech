Child abuse content scanner using T5 and CDS triggers,"In line with the US federal law requiring providers to report child sexual abuse content to NCMEC, this feature scans uploads and flags suspected materials tagged as T5. Once flagged, the CDS auto-generates reports and routes them via secure channel APIs. The logic runs in real-time, supports human validation, and logs detection metadata for internal audits.

Content visibility lock with NSP for EU DSA,"To meet the transparency expectations of the EU Digital Services Act, we are introducing a visibility lock for flagged user-generated content labeled under NSP. When such content is detected, a soft Softblock is applied and GH ensures enforcement is restricted to the EU region only. EchoTrace supports traceability, and Redline status can be triggered for legal review.
