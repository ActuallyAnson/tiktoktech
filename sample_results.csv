REQUIRED,"The feature description explicitly mentions 'GDPR compliance', which is a specific regulation applicable to the EU region. This directly aligns with the 'REQUIRED' classification rule for features mentioning specific laws/regulations for specific regions with compliance language.",0.95,['GDPR'],ASL for EU,Age-sensitive logic for EU,ASL for EU,Age-sensitive logic for GDPR compliance,2025-08-26T15:08:06.898075
NOT REQUIRED,"The feature is a technical bug fix for a memory leak, which is a universal improvement to platform stability and performance. There is no mention of specific laws, regulations, compliance language, or region-specific legal requirements.",1.0,[],Bug fix,Bug fix,Bug fix,Fixed memory leak in video processing,2025-08-26T15:08:10.562370
NEEDS HUMAN REVIEW,"The feature 'Age verification' is inherently linked to legal and regulatory compliance across various regions (e.g., age-restricted content laws, data privacy laws like GDPR/COPPA, child safety regulations). However, the description 'Enhanced age verification system' provides no explicit mention of specific laws, regulations, regions, or compliance intent. Without this crucial information, it is unclear whether the enhancement is a universal business decision, a response to a new or existing geo-specific legal requirement, or a platform-wide effort to meet the highest common denominator of age-related regulations. The strict criteria for 'REQUIRED' (explicit law names, compliance language, region-specific legal requirements) are not met, yet classifying it as 'NOT REQUIRED' would ignore the strong implicit connection between age verification and legal obligations. Therefore, the intent is ambiguous, warranting human review.",0.9,[],Age verification,Age verification,Age verification,Enhanced age verification system,2025-08-26T15:08:19.671880
